# Hi, I'm Ujwal 👋

I am a First Year engineering student with a passion for building things with code. I’m currently focused on learning the fundamentals so I can explore different fields like Software Engineering, Web Development and Game Dev.

### What I’m learning right now:
* **C & Python:** Getting my logic and basics strong.
* **The Plan:** Moving on to Java and eventually exploring Web frameworks and Unity/C#.

### My Goal:
I want to become a versatile developer who can work across different platforms. Right now, I'm just enjoying the process of learning how to code and building my first few projects.
